# PLP Python Programming – Week 3 Assignment

## Description
This project contains a Python function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price of an item based on the discount provided. If the discount percentage is 20% or more, it applies the discount; otherwise, it returns the original price.

The script prompts the user to input the original price and discount percentage, then displays the appropriate final price.

## Features
- Function with conditional logic
- User input for price and discount
- Returns discounted or original price based on the percentage
- Error handling for invalid input


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of functions, input/output, and conditionals

## Sample Output
```
Enter the original price of the item: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied. Final price: KES 750.00
```

```
Enter the original price of the item: 1500
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Final price: KES 1500.00
```
